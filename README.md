# Project 5: The Two Towers

This Java project solves the Two Towers puzzle, where the goal is to divide `n` uniquely sized blocks into two towers whose total heights are as close as possible.

## Files
- `TwoTowers.java`: Contains the main logic and variables for solving the problem.
- `SubsetIterator.java`: A generic iterator to enumerate all subsets of a list using bit manipulation.
- `README.txt`: Includes answers to thought questions and runtime analysis.

## Features
- Exhaustively checks all subsets using a binary-counting approach.
- Computes optimal subset height close to half the total height.
- Tracks real-world execution time in milliseconds.

## How to Run
Compile and run `TwoTowers.java`. It will prompt you to enter the number of blocks and print the optimal solution details.
